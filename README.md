# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then I will be using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. I will be using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. I will compare the two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and make a conclusion whether to use these models to predict credit risk.

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results. There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models


## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
